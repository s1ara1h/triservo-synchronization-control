# ðŸ¤– TriServo Synchronization Control System


## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
The TriServo Synchronization Control System is an educational Arduino-based project that demonstrates how to control multiple servo motors in a synchronized and coordinated manner. This project serves as a foundation for learning robotics and motor control, and can be further developed for more complex applications such as robotic arms or automation systems.

*Three servo motors working in perfect synchronization*

### ðŸŽ¬ Live Demo Features:
- **Synchronized Movement**: All three servos move in perfect harmony
- **Precise Positioning**: Accurate movement from 0Â° to 180Â° and back
- **Smooth Operation**: Gradual movement with 15ms delays for stability
- **Continuous Cycle**: Automated loop for demonstration purposes
